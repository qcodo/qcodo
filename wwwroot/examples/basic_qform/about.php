		<div class="instruction_title">About Sections 4 - 10</div>
		Sections 4 through 10 focus on the <b>QForm</b> and the <b>QControl</b> libraries.  In order
		to focus on just the view and controller layer functionality that QForms offers, the concepts of
		code generated objects and components are only discussed minimally.<br/><br/>

		Any examples that utilize code generated objects (which subsequently is using the database)
		will be marked with a "*".  If you would like more information on how these objects are
		generated or how they work, we recommend that you check out sections 1 - 3 of the examples.
